    <h2 class="has-text-justify is-size-5">The problem that we have decided to solve is a way to
        figure out which movies are the most economically successful based
        on their box office earnings accumulated from their screening cycles.
        We want to provide valuable information regarding the popularity and
        revenue of these movies in any given year. This question is more geared
        towards the entertainment business and anyone who is interested about movies.
        The film industry will be able to use this information to get an idea for
        specific films relating by genre and the movie goers will be able to get
        their answers regarding some questions they have about the movie.
        By using the IMDB database we will be able to implement a system that will show
        the duration, top grossing films, movie ratings by critics, and several other
        statistics from the past twenty years. Combining all of this into a convenient
        and interactive web application, will create an enjoyable experience while
        serving as an aide to answer questions one might have about a movie.</h2>
