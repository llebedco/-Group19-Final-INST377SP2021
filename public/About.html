    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p class="The problem that we have decided to solve is a way to 
    figure out which movies are the most economically successful based 
    on their box office earnings accumulated from their screening cycles. 
    We want to provide valuable information regarding the popularity and 
    revenue of these movies in any given year. This question is more geared 
    towards the entertainment business and anyone who is interested about movies. 
    The film industry will be able to use this information to get an idea for 
    specific films relating by genre and the movie goers will be able to get 
    their answers regarding some questions they have about the movie. 
    By using the IMDB database we will be able to implement a system that will show 
    the duration, top grossing films, movie ratings by critics, and several other 
    statistics from the past twenty years. Combining all of this into a convenient 
    and interactive web application, will create an enjoyable experience while 
    serving as an aide to answer questions one might have about a movie."></p>
