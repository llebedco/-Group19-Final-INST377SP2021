            figure out which movies are the most economically successful based
            on their box office earnings accumulated from their screening cycles.
            We want to provide valuable information regarding the popularity and
            revenue of these movies in any given year. This question is more geared
            towards the entertainment business and anyone who is interested about movies.
            The film industry will be able to use this information to get an idea for
            specific films relating by genre and the movie goers will be able to get
            their answers regarding some questions they have about the movie.
            By using the IMDB database we will be able to implement a system that will show
            the duration, top grossing films, movie ratings by critics, and several other
            statistics from the past twenty years. Combining all of this into a convenient
            and interactive web application, will create an enjoyable experience while
            serving as an aide to answer questions one might have about a movie.</p>
